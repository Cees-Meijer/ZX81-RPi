* Notes on running certain games		-*- outline -*-

* QS Defender

The version of QS Defender on both WoS and NVG just dumps some Dutch
text at you when you run it. What you have to do to get a runnable
version is delete lines 3 to 18 inclusive - you'll probably want to
save it before running, to save having to do this every time.

And don't forget to run the emulator with `-a q' for sound. :-)


* Rock Crush and Dan's Revenge

These load in a slightly odd way, using multiple .p files. Make sure
you have *all* of them in the directory you're loading e.g. crush.p
from, or it won't work.
